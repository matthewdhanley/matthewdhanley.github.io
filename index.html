                              I was hired on as a Command Controller at the LASP in May of 2016. The first three months
                              consisted of a training program to certify myself and eight others to be able to work on
                              console with multiple different NASA spacecraft. By the end of the summer, I was one of few
                              students who had the privelage to command these spacecraft.

                              Shortly after certifying, I was added to multiple spacecraft subsystems. These included the
                              Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem on <a href="https://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/">QuikSCAT</a>,
                              the Electrical Power Distribution Subsystem
                              on <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/">SORCE</a> and
                              <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/index.html">AIM</a>, SORCE SIM and TIM instruments, and others.
                              On all these subsystem teams, I performed unique tasks to help benefit the spacecraft as a whole. Below are short
                              blurbs about some of the projects I worked on early at my time at LASP.

                          <p class="text-white">When I became lead of the SORCE SIM subsystem, I found that the script
                          that calculates and stores science experiment success statistics was incredibly slow (on the
                          order of multiple hours for retrieving data for a single month). I took it upon myself to
                          rewrite the code to not only work faster, but also smarter. Using IDL (LASP standard, not my first choice...),
                          I implemented a system that evaluates experiment success by extracting scheduled activities and comparing
                          with telemetry data. Doing this, I was able to determine if, when, and why a certain experiment failed. This
                          data was then stored in a relational SQLite database for fast retrieval in the future. This updated code
                          took a process that took hours per month and brought it down to just a few minutes.</p>

                          <p class="text-white">On QuikSCAT, there was a frequent problem that would occur with the reaction
                          wheels. Occasionally, there would be a "jag" (a.k.a. torque drag) that would occur on one of the
                          four wheels. The analysis started with the hypothesis that the frequency of the jags were
                          temperature dependent, however I proved this to be false. Although the results were underwhelming,
                          I created a new tool for telemetry analysis. Using IDL Widgets, something that was not really
                          done at LASP before, I created a tool to look for correlation between telemetry points. Using
                          a 2D binning technique, I was able to construct a heat map that showed not only any correlations
                          between variables, but included a time intensity aspect using a rainbow coloring scheme. For me,
                          this plot allowed me to quickly see if torque increases were temporary or persistent for long periods
                          of time. Fun fact, the idea for this tool came from a common 2D histogram technique used in
                          computer vision!</p>

                          <p class="text-white">When I joined the AIM Power subsystem, I was taught how to make lunar
                              shadow predictions. These are made whenever there is a solar eclipse that could affect the spacecraft
                              as we do not want to have a situation where the spacecraft undervoltages and is kicked into a
                              safemode (espically on AIM since bitlock was non-existant and recovery would be near impossible).
                              At a high level, the process consists of obtaining a Solar Intensity Report from STK and feeding
                              it into some custom code that would scale existing solar array current based on the solar
                              intensity as generated by STK. Using this information, we could calculate how much the battery
                              would discharge due to insufficient energy and use this knowledge to provide recommendations
                              to the flight director on how effects could be mitigated. When learning this process, the common
                              theme seemed to be "this usually doesn't work." The code never seemed to run to completion and
                              hours were wasted every time a lunar shadow approached. This time waste didn't make sense to me. So
                              instead of spending hours debugging poorly documented code, I took it upon myself to rewrite the
                              code to elminate time waste and improve the results. I created a GUI in IDL that had minimal
                              inputs and output valuable plots. I was also able to model attitude mode behavior in the predictions
                              to produce the most accurate results possible. To quote the lead of the subsystem, "This tool
                              is magical."</p>

                              Nearing the end of my first year at LASP, I began to dabble with web projects. Eventually,
                              I was added to the mission operations student web team. On this team, I created multiple
                              tools to help benefit the entire flight operations team. This helped me gain experience in
                              HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. I also learned that I enjoy full stack web development. Some
                              examples of my projects are listed below. Unfortunately due to ITAR restrictions, I can't post

                          <p class="text-white">The LASP Proc (short for Procedure) Reader was the brainchild of a student
                          before me. He implemented it for two missions, hard coding much of the logic to be mission specific.
                          I took his idea and gave it a makeover. The tool has many purposes. First, it provides syntax
                          highlighting for CSTOL (Colorado System Test Operational Language, used for commanding LASP's
                          spacecraft). Second, it allows users to easily follow the procedures. Procedures have many calls
                          to other procedures (like calling a function from a function), and my tool allows the user to jump
                          to the procedure that is called. It also allows a user to see an outline of the entire procedure
                          in a navigation pane. This is useful for procedures, such as the Kepler Quarterly procedure, that
                          are thousands of lines long. A user can easily jump to a specific section from anywhere in the
                          procedure. The program also allows users to follow "GOTO" statements that redirect procedure
                          flow to other labels in the file. With PHP and JS, I was able to provide these features for
                          all of our missions, automatically.</p>

                          <p class="text-white">SORCE is an incredibly complex spacecraft, as discussed in this
                          <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2018-2619">paper</a> by my colleagues. Every
                          orbit, all power draws that are not necessary to survival (and sometimes even those that are vital) are
                          turned off at Earth eclipse entry. Once the spacecraft comes back into the sun, it must completely
                          reconfigure itself and prepare to take science! This means there are multiple levels of automation. Relative
                          time sequences can be loaded from the ground to spacecraft RAM that can be executed from the ground automation,
                          absolute timed sequneces, on-board telemetry monitors, or other relative time sequneces. That is just one
                          example of the complexity of the automation. So tracking something down like the source of a charge rate change
                          can be challenging. I created a tool that shows what code calls what and where the calls originate. It allows
                          operators to easily follow the flow of a signal or back out the origin of a response. Plus, the graph looks cool! It
                              was done using <a href="http://visjs.org/">VisJS</a> in conjunction with custom PHP to allow users
                          who are unfamiliar with web development to easily update nodes and edges. In the image below, each node is action.
                          The actions are connected with directional edges. The actions are color coded by their origination. Zooming
                          in with the scroll wheel allows users to quickly view information about the actions.</p>

                          <p class="text-white">One of the big selling points of LASP as mission operators is that we
                          thoroughly check telemetry for all of our missions daily. This allows us to catch large anomalies
                          before they happen. In order to do this, there must be a log of who has checked what subsystems' telemetry.
                          This was traditionally done using Python CGI and plain HTML. This worked great...in 2001. Now, we all have
                          smart phones and plain HTML looks, well, plain. As a project to learn about Bootstrap, I revamped the plain
                          HTML log and added some features. I created a grid that showed which telemetry was checked and which wasn't. I
                          also created features that allow users to sort by checked status or mission to quickly determine if telemetry
                          still needed checking. On top of it all, I added some fun animations when the cards were sorted. A basic project,
                          but it got me excited about web development.</p>
